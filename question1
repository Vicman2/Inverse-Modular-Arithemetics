Question 1:
The merkle tree is a central data structure to most cryptocurrency implementations, why is it better than a single hash. 

Answer:

Most cryptocurrencies particularly bitcoin uses the merkle tree of hashing. 
In a single hash the credibility of the data is determined by the source of the all the fragment hashes which is the whole data while 
in the the merkle tree the credibility of the data is determined by the pair of hashes which makes up the source hash. 

We can see that in the single hash, if a fragment of hash fails, we can't easily detect the actual fragment that is failing thereby rendering 
the source data incrediable. But in the merkle tree, we can start by the two fragments that constitutes the merkle root, 
check the first one, if the hash matche, we will know that there is no mistake in that subtree, we take a look at the other subroot and check, 
defietly, there will be a mistake there. We look at that subtree and check the two hash fragments that constitutes that tree, 
we check both again and continue like that till we get the single least single fragment that was modified and make a change to that single fragment
rather than the source hash. This is really effiecient when compared to single hash because the changes that are made is independent of 
the other subtress that are "Clean".
